You, Arjun, are not in a mood to take up further cases, but Kajal brings in the trouble. She is approached by Mrs. Annapoorni and she complains her of her missing daughter. Her name is Megha, and she's a topper. She has got 6 gold
medals in 7 semesters. That is why, she gets involved in quarrels and fights due to her ego. The last semester happened a month ago. She was so sure that she'll get the first rank in this semester too. But she got the 6th rank. She was
surprised after that. She went into depression, but then, as a move on, her friends requested her to attend a camp in Maduramangalam. She went on last saturday and she was supposed to return on Monday, but she never returned. Before they even start the investigation, Arjun and Kajal are called to Radisson Blu hotel Chennai, and see that the place is crowded, with media and police surrounding the entrance. A dead body of a girl lies in the bathroom, and
Kajal gets shocked after recognizing that it is Meghna. The body is cut very dangerously. In both her hands there are marks of cut, and there is a big deep cut from her wrist to her elbow on both her hands. Meanwhile, Anu, Arjun's ex-fiance goes to the chair in which Mr. Domnasian's toy is attached and gets a bad smell and notices a blood drop in the chair. Mr. Domnasian's statue is being cut opened. A dead body comes out of it. You don't understand what's happening here, but Annapoorni and Meghna's friends do have things to say to you. Go ahead and start the investigation...
