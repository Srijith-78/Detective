Probably the weirdest case in Arjun's career. Arjun in his new house, Goa alone, when He turns off the radio, and peeps outside. The whole street is void of people, until he notices his neighbor Laxmi being held NAKED BY A
GROUP!! They are dressed as assasins, uniformly Black T-Shirt and Black pant. In between them is a person wearing the dress of the character "Catwoman" from "DC". The person takes a knife and STABS LAXMI IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET! Arjun gets shocked and rushes to the street, but there's no one there. He knocks on LAXMI's door, but she ANSWERS his call. He sees LAXMI alive yet again. He even has a good talk with her. His curiousity grows as his servant skips work on many days and gives lame reasons. The next day, LAXMI is reported dead, and MAYA, the IO investigates you. But this is more than a case to you, so you join her in the investigation.
